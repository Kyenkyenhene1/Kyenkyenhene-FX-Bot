I want you to act as a professional MQL5 algorithm developer and Forex quant researcher. Build a fully functional and backtest-ready Forex trading bot in MQL5 for MetaTrader 5 with the following dual-mode strategy logic: ________________________________________ ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Modes: 1.	ML Core Mode: o	Use Python (via MetaTrader-Python bridge) to run a machine learning classifier (XGBoost or TensorFlow). o	Model is trained to predict buy/sell based on: ÔÇß	OHLCV data (up to 100 candles) ÔÇß	Moving Averages (EMA20, EMA50, EMA200) ÔÇß	RSI, MACD, Stochastic ÔÇß	Candle patterns (e.g., engulfing, pin bar) ÔÇß	News filter sentiment score (if available) o	Entry on confirmation of signal + favorable spread. o	Includes trailing stop, break-even logic, and dynamic SL/TP based on volatility. 2.	Royal Structure Mode (OB/FVG Inspired): o	Detect Order Blocks (OB) and Fair Value Gaps (FVG) using smart logic: ÔÇß	OB = Large candle with imbalance before reversal ÔÇß	FVG = Gaps between candle wicks o	Confirm entries with: ÔÇß	Market structure shift (high/low breaks) ÔÇß	ML confidence score above threshold o	Entry on retracement to OB or FVG o	Optional confluence: Fibonacci level, volume spike ________________________________________ üß± Risk & Trade Management: ‚Ä¢	Max 5 layers per trade (auto-scaled based on confidence score) ‚Ä¢	No more than 10 trades/day ‚Ä¢	SL: Based on structure or ATR ‚Ä¢	TP: RR of 1:2 or dynamic trailing TP ‚Ä¢	Equity-based risk allocation: e.g., 1‚Äì3% per trade ‚Ä¢	Trade pause on high-impact news (optional) ‚Ä¢	Dashboard panel with active trades, P&L, ML signal strength and signals of available trade ‚Ä¢	Alerts via email, Telegram, GUI and Whatsapp ________________________________________ üß™ Features Required: ‚Ä¢	Full backtesting support (10 years) ‚Ä¢	Export trade logs (CSV) ‚Ä¢	ML model retrain scheduler ‚Ä¢	‚ÄúRoyal Structure Mode‚Äù toggle on GUI ‚Ä¢	Auto-installer folder-ready package ‚Ä¢	Clean MQL5 code with comments ________________________________________ üì§ Deliverables: ‚Ä¢	MQL5 bot file (.mq5 + .ex5) ‚Ä¢	Python ML script (XGBoost or TF) ‚Ä¢	JSON config for strategy toggles ‚Ä¢	Installer script or ZIP structure ‚Ä¢	Documentation PDF (setup + strategy) ________________________________________ üîÅ Output Format: Provide the entire project as a structured folder or ZIP, including: ‚Ä¢	Source files ‚Ä¢	ML model ‚Ä¢	Strategy docs ‚Ä¢	Test results if available
